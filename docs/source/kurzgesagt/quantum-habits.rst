Atomic Habits
########################################################################

============================================================================
A. Convincing argument
============================================================================
Exponential curve of 1.1% vs 1% over sufficiently large amount of time

============================================================================
B. Essentials
============================================================================
1. Cue - hacks: time and space, kickstart
  - Find time & place where ideas work best (e.g., coffee place in the morning, sitting in a jungle, sitting beside the sea).
  - Establish rituals - without forming an obsession.
  - Simulate if needed
2. Craving - hacks: tie with attractiveness/value system 
  - piggyback on your natural craving for social recognition (be part of groups where desired behaviour is the norm) 
  - dopamine tricks - merge want + need
  - create identity around systems instead of goals
3. Execution - hacks:
  - make it easy - break it down into quantum chunks (2 mins rule)
  - number of invocation triumphs over cumulative time spent
4. Reward - hacks:
  - be okay with delayed gratification
  - be okay with the reward of dopamine boost from making progress without having to form narratives around it 
  - make it easy to measure progress, not that all of it should matter though.

============================================================================
C. Advanced
============================================================================
1. The gene view - play your strength
2. Goldilocks zone for engagement vs boredom - choosing the tasks at the right difficulty level is the key to engagement and reward
3. Swiss army knife - dangers of automation
