What is this section for?

A collection of summary-notes from various non-academic books.

What is the format of this?

Whenever possible, I'll try to follow the spirit mentioned in this `blog post <https://www.andreasfragner.com/writing/writing-summaries>`_.

- In 1-2 sentences, what is the book about as a whole?
- What are the 3-4 central questions it tries to answer?
- Summarize the answers in one paragraph each.
- What are the most important things you have learned personally?
