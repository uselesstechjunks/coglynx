Understanding Mind-Games

============================================================================
(A) Mind games
============================================================================

Motivations

    Want something without being explicit.
    Test loyalties, withhold info, play people against each other for leverage.
    Hide behind plausible deniability.

Forms

    Lying - gaslighting, inconsistency. Bypassing accountability.
    Withholding information and then redirect blame ("I thought you knew..."). Sabotage credibility.
    Grooming alliances to gain information, flattery for favours.
    Riding coattails - shared ownership of something you created.
    Triangulation - reference what "some people" allegedly said. Divide-and-conquer.
    Fishing for sensitive information but downplay the seriousness ("Just curious..."). Information-gathering for leverage. Trap you into saying something that could be used against you.
    Passive-aggressive (joke-masked criticisms or backhanded praise). Power play. Compliment in public but undermine in private.

Actions

    Stay respectful, but firm and clear.
    Use reflective questions to slow the conversation ("Why do you ask?").
    Build quiet alliances with genuinely trustworthy peers.
    Watch for patterns, not isolated moments.
    Document interactions when stakes are high.
    Keep critical conversations in writing.
    Limit sharing non-work stuff.

============================================================================
(B) Undesired behaviour
============================================================================

Characteristics

    Lack of training, emotional self-awareness, or stress.
    Not malicious - just not well-managed.
    Fixable if willing.

Examples

    Interrupting due to enthusiasm or poor listening.
    Being passive out of fear, not strategy.
    Being too blunt due to poor emotional intelligence.
    Withdrawing in meetings because they're unsure of their role.
    Not following through due to bad prioritization or overwhelm.

Actions

    Be direct but empathetic: "I noticed X - can we talk about what's behind it?"
    Give clarity, mentorship, set expectations.
    Model better behavior.
    Don't label someone a "politician” unless patterns truly show intent.

Important - How to tell them apart? Try to understand their motivation. If YES to 3+, likely mind game.

    Is this person playing with information?
    Do they say one thing and do another - repeatedly?
    Do they seem more focused on perception than results?
    Do they create confusion around responsibility or accountability?
    If I give feedback, do they adjust - or deflect and blame?

I can

    Avoid mind games by being grounded, clear, and consistent.
    Reduce undesired behaviors in myself and others through awareness, communication, setting expectations, and patience. 

(C) Desired behaviour
Leadership viewpoint

    Clear communicator - simplify complex things without sounding superior.
    Honest - even when uncomfortable.
    Credible - estimate reasonably, deliver what's promised, own mistakes.
    Proactive - spot problems early, solve, take initiative.
    Growth mindset - open to feedback, always learning.
    Calm - under pressure. 

Peer Viewpoint

    Predictable; people don't have to "walk on eggshells."
    Respectful of time, space, differences.
    Approachable, even when busy or stressed.
    Collaborative - share ideas, listen, work with rather than around others. 
    Non-defensive - can disagree without escalating.
